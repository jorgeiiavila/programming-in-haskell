expr ::= term + expr | term
term ::= factor * term | factor
factor ::= (expr) | nat
nat ::= 0 | 1 | 2 ...

Draw the parse trees for the following expressions:

a. 2+3 

                expr
        /        |        \
      term       +        expr
       |                   |
     factor               term
       |                   |
      nat                factor
       |                   |
       2                  nat
                           |
                           3           

b. 2*3*4

          expr
           |
          term
   /       |         \
 factor    *        term
   |            /    |    \
  nat        factor  *   term
   |           |           |
